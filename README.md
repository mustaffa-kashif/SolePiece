## Project Description
I created an immersive **RPG text-based game** in **Java**, featuring dynamic action battles, customizable inventories, and rich interactions with NPCs (Non-Player Characters). The game is designed to provide an engaging experience with multiple story outcomes, driven by the player's decisions and interactions, ensuring a high level of replayability. 

Additionally, the game includes a **game-saving functionality**, allowing players to save their progress at any point and continue their adventure later. This was implemented using file handling to store objects and player stats. I utilized classes and the full spectrum of Java’s features to create a robust gaming experience. To add a unique visual flair, the game incorporates **ASCII art**, enhancing the immersion within the text-based interface. 

The project was fully developed on the **NetBeans** platform, showcasing my skills in **Java programming** and game design.

## Features
- **Action Battles:** Engage in turn-based combat against a variety of enemies, using strategy to manage health and inventory effectively.
- **Customizable Inventories:** Manage and equip items that can assist you throughout your journey, providing strategic advantages in battles.
- **Dynamic NPC Interactions:** Each NPC you encounter has unique dialogue, stories, and personalities, creating a rich narrative experience.
- **Multiple Endings:** The story evolves based on the player’s decisions, offering several different endings that provide unique and varied gameplay experiences.
- **Game Saving:** Save and load your progress anytime, ensuring players can return to their journey whenever they wish.
- **ASCII Art:** Enhances the game’s atmosphere by providing simple yet immersive visuals that accompany the text-based gameplay.

## How to Play
To play the game, you need to set up a **Java development environment**. Below are the steps to get started:

1. **Download and Set Up the Development Environment:**
   - Option 1: **NetBeans** – Recommended for running the project locally.
   - Option 2: **Replit** – Run the game in an online coding environment if you prefer not to set up locally.

2. **Transfer the Files:**
   - Clone or download the project files into your development environment (NetBeans or Replit).

3. **Run the Game:**
   - In **NetBeans**: Open the project, locate the `Main.java` file, and click "Run".
   - In **Replit**: Upload the files and press "Run".

4. **Start Your Adventure:**
   - Follow the prompts, engage in battles, make decisions, and explore the world!

## Technical Details
- **Language:** Java
- **Platform:** NetBeans (primary) / Replit (optional)
- **Key Concepts:** Object-oriented programming (OOP), file handling, and game mechanics.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Java Programming:** Utilized classes, object-oriented principles, and file handling for game-saving functionality.
- **Game Design:** Developed core mechanics such as combat systems, decision trees for multiple endings, and inventory management.
- **User Interaction:** Created rich player interactions through NPC dialogues and game progression driven by player choices.
- **ASCII Art:** Introduced visual elements using ASCII art, enhancing the atmosphere and visual engagement in a text-based game.

## Future Improvements
- **Enhanced AI:** Add more advanced NPC behavior, improving the complexity of interactions and combat encounters.
- **Expanded Storylines:** Introduce additional side quests and branching narratives, increasing replayability.
- **Multiplayer Mode:** Consider adding support for a multiplayer version where players can cooperate or compete in battles.
- **GUI Implementation:** Build a graphical user interface to complement the existing text-based game for broader audience appeal.

## Conclusion
This **RPG text-based game** project demonstrates my proficiency in **Java programming**, applying core concepts such as object-oriented design, file handling, and class structures to build an engaging gaming experience. The inclusion of **ASCII art** and game-saving functionality highlights my attention to both **user experience** and **software functionality**. This project not only showcases my technical skills but also my ability to design, develop, and enhance gameplay through narrative and interactive elements.
